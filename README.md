## 1.2. Gaining Access to Css

In order to access the use of Itch.io Css functionality we first need to:
* Read details about Itch.io Css & what is requested from you as a developer in order to get access to it.
* Information about the proper use of Itch.io Css editing can be read from here: [Creators Guide to Itch.io Css Editing](https://itch.io/docs/creators/css-guide)

#### The CSS editor is available on:

* Project pages (Including Devlog posts)
* Jam pages
* Profile pages

### Introduction

The CSS editor lets you control how your pages look outside of what the built-in theme editor allows. Keep in mind we sometimes upgrade itch.io’s pages and it’s difficult to ensure those changes don’t conflict with your custom CSS. Enhancing existing components instead of trying to redo the entire page is the best way to avoid any problems.

The CSS classes and IDs listed on this page should be considered stable and you can use them for targets to your customization. Use any other CSS classes at your own risk, future updates to itch.io may not be compatible with your CSS. We'll do our best to be conservative about changes, but sometimes we have to make them. If we make major changes, we'll try to email all CSS users about the updates.

CSS generated by the itch.io theme editors is applied using CSS classes, so you can use ID selectors to have your style take higher precedence.

### Custom classes
The content you provide for your pages (project, profile, jam, etc.) supports a subset of HTML. If you'd like to target elements in your markup with custom CSS you can give them a class. In order to prevent conflict with itch.io’s own CSS, classes you use must begin with custom-. Any other classes you provide will be stripped by the sanitizer.

To access HTML mode in our rich text editor, you can click the <> button. Once you start writing HTML with the rich text editor then we recommend only editing as HTML, as the rich text editor may rewrite your markup and strip tags you have added.
